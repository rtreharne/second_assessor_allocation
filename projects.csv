I am currently a second-year Biochemistry student with an average score of 77. In addition to my academic studies, I have extensive  research experience in laboratory. As a result, I have built a solid foundation of knowledge and laboratory skills.

My future research interests are focused on cancer classification, using clinical omics as the primary research method. I hope to learn cancer research techniques through my graduation project and, if possible, integrate omics approaches into the research.

I am a highly motivated and diligent student, and it would be a great honor to carry out my graduation project under your supervision. Of course, I fully understand that research directions need to align with the overall objectives of the group. If my initial ideas are not entirely feasible, I am more than willing to adapt. I believe that the most important outcome is to learn how to formulate and complete a meaningful research project. I simply wished to share my thoughts with you.",no,1,

On a personal level, I’ve always been drawn to the idea of working in drug discovery because of the potential to improve people’s lives, and I see bioinformatics as one of the most powerful tools in that area today.

The Long-Term Educational Impact of COVID-19 on Key Stage Transitions in Science.
This project aligns closely with my career aspiration to become a secondary school science teacher and builds directly on my existing experience in both primary and secondary school settings. I have already established strong working relationships with local teachers, which will enable me to access meaningful data through interviews, surveys, and collaborative research.
I have create a one-note file and begun early planning and background reading around this topic, including literature on curriculum alignment, learning loss post-COVID, and science education transition strategies. 
My research will explore questions such as:
* To what extent has the COVID-19 pandemic affected students’ science readiness at secondary schooll level?
* Has the curriculum gap between primary and secondary widened since COVID?
* How effective are current transition and outreach strategies in science?
* What practical responses have teachers implemented to address observed knowledge or engagement dips?
This project will allow me to apply my academic background in Biomed to a relevant educational issue, while developing valuable skills in data collection, educational research methods, and real-world curriculum analysis. Given my access to schools and the feasibility of the research, I am confident this project will produce a thought through academic piece of writing.",no,6,EC: ok

During my previous SURF  project, our team tried to establish a gene editing system for one species of Bacteroidetes, enabling targeted gene knockouts, strong promoter insertion, and transposon mutagenesis. This experience provided me with hands-on expertise in primer design, plasmid construction, gene disruption, and phenotype screening. I back to continue the research this summer and work with my team. We try to establish a new complementing plasmid to complement the targeted gene and achieve success. We will continue to try to apply this plasmid to more different species for Bacteroidetes. 
For my final year project, I am interested in continuing wet-lab research that allow me to apply and further develop these skills. Cause I have got some information and skills from bacteria, I hope to be matched with a project where I can contribute meaningfully using my current expertise while expanding my training in molecular cell biology, cancer cell signaling or multi-omits. I believe that no matter which project comes next, it will enhance and enrich my knowledge.

Future Development Direction and Research Interests
I hope to deepen my understanding of electrophysiology, neurobiology, and related fields through my undergraduate FYP project. I aim to enhance my data analysis and laboratory skills, broaden my academic perspective, and accumulate valuable research experience, which will better support my future graduate studies and research.

2. Neuroengineering and Data Analysis Skills
I interned at Peking Union Medical College Institute of Biomedical Engineering, where I participated in a brain-computer interface (BCI) project focusing on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) signal processing and decoding. Through this experience, I developed proficiency in MATLAB programming and data analysis, and became familiar with EEG and EMG signal acquisition and processing, gaining a solid understanding of neural signal interpretation.

3. Biomedical Laboratory Skills
During my freshman year, I participated in a year-long project on the screening of coding and non-coding RNAs related to pancreatic cancer. This allowed me to gain hands-on experience in cell culture, genetic engineering, and plasmid construction, equipping me with practical skills in molecular and cellular biology. It also deepened my understanding of cell behavior regulation and gene expression.

4. Foundation in Electrophysiology
I have systematically studied the fundamental principles of electrophysiology through extracurricular courses. I understand the mechanisms of ion channels, membrane potentials, and action potentials, enabling me to analyze and interpret electrophysiological processes in both cardiac and nervous systems.",no,7,

I have hands-on experience working with various microorganisms and cell systems. Notably, I have cultured Dunaliella tertiolecta for β-carotene production under stress conditions (light filters, temperature, and pH), and worked with E. coli to study antimicrobial resistance (AMR) using antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline.

Additionally, I completed a research internship project on enzyme kinetics involving Human MDH1 and Plasmodium falciparum MDH. This involved monitoring enzyme activity under different buffers, temperatures, and pH conditions. I also explored the structural and functional background of both enzymes to better understand their roles in metabolic pathways and pathogen-specific characteristics.

Through these experiences, I have developed proficiency in core laboratory techniques such as gel electrophoresis, microscopy, micro-pipetting, 96-well plate assays, and bacterial streaking methods. My academic background and practical training have strengthened my analytical skills and scientific curiosity. I am confident that I can contribute meaningfully to a project aligned with my interests, particularly in laboratory or computational settings focusing on infectious diseases and molecular biology.",no,2,

I have previously carried out conservation work in Africa which has driven my interest in how trade policy affects elephant populations, local communities and enforcement efforts.

When discussing this idea with colleagues, I’ve often encountered comparisons to drug legalisation; I find this an interesting parallel. Like with regulated drug markets, the argument for legalising ivory trade hinges on controlling and taxing the trade to reduce demand, decrease illegal activity and improve oversight. I’d like to critically examine whether such regulation could offer a better alternative to total trade bans.
